This is the mini project that i made by using Python.
This project is like a small game ,where program generates a number between 1 to 100 .If we wants to play this game then we have to guess that number.
This program  also gives hint about the number generated by it ,by telling number entered by user is smaller or greater.
If we want to quit the game we can press "Q".
